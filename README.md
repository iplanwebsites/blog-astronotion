Webtrotion is a simple to install, configurable to $n^{th}$ limit starter built with the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) in conjunction with [Notion](notion://www.notion.so/). Use it to create an easy-to-use blog **or website.**

# Acknowledgements

This theme is built based off three major contributions:

1. [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus)
2. [notion-astro-blog](https://github.com/otoyo/astro-notion-blog)
3. [And this person on fiverr who got me 80% there on how to integrate notion into cactus theme](https://www.fiverr.com/franklinshera?source=inbox)

# Why Webtrotion

Webtrotion was built with the simple idea - most notion based builders, require at least one of these four things:

- A custom domain, or being willing to use a vercel like domain
- Just have blogposts be editable in Notion while pages are edited in the repo
- Require some third party tools, or are not free to use.
- Are not configurable because they are either based off third parties like [super.so](http://super.so) or the configuring requires editing multiple code files.

And I did not want that. We want something that converts well into a static site, can be hosted on github for free using the [github.io](http://github.io) domain, and can have both pages and blog posts and be configured pretty easily.

## Why Notion *and* Astro

- I use Notion for all my notes, and it did not make sense for me to download them into an md file, carefully figure out the logistics and push/pull with other SSGs like Quartro, Eleventy, Hugo or Jekyll.
- I could have used another CMS but again, I use Notion, and it is easier to keep the content in one place. Notion also comes with interesting affordances that other CMS don‚Äôt: WYSIWYG for various components, block level permissions (to add drafts to post text), easy collaboration etc.
- There are some NextJS options that kinda fulfill this criteria but I do not know NextJS and I did not want to figure it out at the moment, for example: [Notion Next](https://github.com/tangly1024/NotionNext), [Morethan-log](https://github.com/morethanmin/morethan-log), and [Notion-Blog-NextJs](https://github.com/samuelkraft/notion-blog-nextjs)

## Demo

Check out the [Demo](https://nerdymomocat-templates.github.io/webtrotion-astro-notion-cms-website-blog/), hosted on Github using Github actions

# Quick start

## Notion Setup

1. Duplicate [this database](https://nerdymomocat.notion.site/169b6e632b7448529120599281265ac5?v=2281c7ec6d3b4ac0961770ae696d4141&pvs=4) into your Notion account. Remember to duplicate it as a standalone new page, rather than into an existing page.
2. Create a [Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion)
3. [Get your API secret](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#get-your-api-secret)
4. Give your [integration permission to the complete database](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions) you just duplicated
5. Get your database id of the database you duplicated. Database id is the 32 character alphanumeric string right after your workspace in the URL. It is the easiest to get this ID on a web browser rather than the Notion app.
![Getting database id from Notion](https://github.com/nerdymomocat-templates/webtrotion-astro-notion-cms-website-blog/assets/125716950/b904b2cf-eb9b-4c04-b836-82a604ea8d47)

## Github Setup

1. Create a new repo from [this template](https://github.com/nerdymomocat-templates/webtrotion-astro-notion-cms-website-blog/generate) if you want to have a one and done standalone repository. If you want to be able to access and sync changes made in the template to your repository, choose to [fork it instead](https://github.com/nerdymomocat-templates/webtrotion-astro-notion-cms-website-blog/generate).

üìù If you ***do not choose to add a custom domain***, the name of your repository matters. If the name of the repository you create is **<username>.github.io**; your website will be accessible at <username>.github.io if you use github actions. If you use any other name, the website will instead be hosted at <username>.github.io/<reponame>.

‚ö†Ô∏è When you first fork the repository, you will see that the github action output fails. This is because we haven‚Äôt added or changed notion integration information. Don‚Äôt worry, once you add those, it will run successfully.

2. In your repository settings:
    1. Uncheck template repository if it is checked.
    2. Turn on **Discussions** in features to use **[Giscus](https://giscus.app/)**
    3. Go to **Actions ‚Üí General** and set it to *Allow All*
    4. Go to **Pages** and set **Source** as **Github Actions**
    5. Go to **Environments** ‚Üí **github-pages**; Scroll down to **Environment Secrets**, click Add New Secret. Set name as **NOTION_API_SECRET** and the value to the API secret you obtained in [Notion Setup](#notion-setup).
3. Go to the actions tab, and choose ***I understand and want to run actions***. On the left sidebar click the action ‚ÄúDeploy Github pages‚Äù. It will show a warning saying the scheduled action is disabled in forks. Click ***Enable workflow***.
4. Set up giscus as mentioned on the website [giscus.app](http://giscus.app). Keep the script it produces open as we will use it in the next step.
5. Go back to your cloned (forked or created through a template) repository.
6. Open file **`constants-config.json`** in the web UI. This file is the complete setup file for your website. For now, we will make four major modifications:
    1. Change `database-id` to your database id that you obtained from Notion.
    2. Add your name to `author` (this is used for HTML semantics and OG image generation)
    3. Add your socials (you can also remove the value for `this-github-repo`)
    4. Add your giscus information to the `giscus` key. If you do not want you use Giscus, remove value for `data-repo` in `giscus` and that will disable the feature.
7. Save the file and commit+merge to the main repo.
8. The github action by default runs every 8 hours or on commits to the repo. This can be modified in `.github/astro.yml` file. You can choose any cron duration.


ü•≥ And we are done! You can access your website on **<username>.github.io** or <username>.github.io/<reponame> depending on what you chose. Checkout all [Supported blocks](https://nerdymomocat-templates.github.io/webtrotion-astro-notion-cms-website-blog/posts/supported-blocks/) but tl;dr all blocks are supported except child databases and child pages. This specific page will show up as insecure because it has a direct HTML injection.

üìù Remember, the cron schedule is by default set to every 8 hours. You can change it to run every 2 hours or if you want to push out a change immediately, you can also [manually run the github action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) if you are deploying on github. The workflow name is ‚ÄúDeploy Github Pages‚Äù.
